# 343-HW1

Git commands I know I'll be using:

git commit: Saves changes without backing up to a repository

git push: save changes (hopefully) to a repository

git pull: load a repository (or one of the branches of a repository) to the local machine for editing (There may be conflicts)

git add: add a file to be saved in the repository

git reset: undo a git add (unstages a file)

git branch: create a branch (-d afterward will delete a branch)

git checkout: go to a branch
